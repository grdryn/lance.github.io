wayback machine very far to get to the good old days of my experience with
Java and C++. For much of my early career, I genuflected regularly in
front of the altar of data encapsulation, object heirarchies and static typing.
And the syntax. Oh the syntax!</p>
<p>But I have changed, of course, and so much of the dogma and ceremony that
I participated in during those times has come to seem a lot less important
than it was 20 years ago. Languages, and developers evolve. But that doesn't
mean there aren't some really good lessons to learn.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, data encapsulation.</p>]]></description><link>http://lanceball.com/words/2016/10/14/data-hiding-in-es6</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://lanceball.com/words/2016/10/14/data-hiding-in-es6</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Oct 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
